# piRNAnalyzer

piRNAnalyzer is a fully automated bash pipeline for the analysis of piRNAs in planarian small RNA Seq samples.

The piRNAnalyzer pipeline includes preprocessing of sequencing data, read mapping, annotation to genomic features, as well as quality control steps. It comes with all pre-built reference files necessary.
